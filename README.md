# Project-minor-2
This project simulates the role of a Junior SOC Analyst investigating a suspected security incident using real network traffic data. A PCAP file captured from an internal system is analyzed using Wireshark to identify malicious activity, determine attacker and victim systems, and extract sensitive data transferred over the network.
